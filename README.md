# 2. Fisrt Semester Assignment
This is my first semester Assignment/project.
It's a four pages website with a page about me, a replica of the Altschool signup page, 
a page with media elements used to create a strong message about myself, 
and lastly a page with table containing the different Schools and Courses available at Altschool.
This is done strictly with just Html and CSS for now.
