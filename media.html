                <p>
                    This is a poster of my favorite movie. The movie is titled <span class="inception">Inception</span>
                    starring one of my favorite actors, <span>leonardo Dicaprio</span> and directed
                    by my favorite and one of the best  movie directors of his generation,
                    <span>Christopher Nolan</span>. This particular movie
                    at its core, explores the power of the mind and the truly incredible things it 
                    can do. When explaining the concept of "extractions" in the dream world and how people
                    can get away with it, Arthur points out that dreams are when the mind is most
                    vulnerable to outside interactions. This movie also explores malleability
                    of time, the untethering of reality, and the depravity of humanity. One important 
                    lesson i learnt from the movie is that <span> "An idea is like a Virus"</span>. In <span>Inception</span>, <span>Dom Cobb</span>, portrayed by 
                    <span>Leonardo DiCaprio</span>, compares ideas to viruses that can take root in the human mind and 
                    change the course of history. The power of an idea cannot be underestimated; this is 
                    encapsulated as one learning in the movie for the viewer. And the lengths the characters 
                    in the movie go to seed the idea in the mind that can alter the realities that can follow. 
                    The lesson here is to recognise the power of our thoughts and beliefs.
                    Our ideas shape our reality, and we can achieve the impossible with the right mindset. 
                    By mastering our minds and understanding the impact of ideas, we can manifest our dreams into 
                    reality.

                <p>This is a soundtrack from the movie <span>Inception</span>. The nostalgic
                    feeling, the calming and soothing nature of this sound further deepens my connection
                    with this particular movie. The composer of this soundtrack, <span>Hans Zimmer</span> is one of the most prominent and 
                    in fact my favorite sound composer.

                    This a short scene from the movie <span>Evan Almighty</span> starring <span>Morgan Freeman</span>
                    as <span>Evan</span> where he gives a powerful advice about an opportunity. Here, he explained to us
                    that God doesn't always give us a specific and clear answer, rather, He gives us the opportunity to find it.
                    when we pray for patience, courage, or closer relationships, God doesn't just make them magically happen or appear.
                    Instead, He presents us with chances to practice patience, to act bravely and to show love and kindness to 
                    those around us. It is now up to us to seize these opportunities and grow. Since i've come across this movie, 
                    it has seriously reshaped my reaction and views towards certain scenarios in my life. It has made me become more
                    conscious of the happenings going on around me and also help me identifty events that could be opportunities and what could be
                    possible answers to my prayers.

                <p>This is a highlight from the 2014 Uefa Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.
                    In this match, Real Madrid was losing till the last minute of the game. Just when all hope seem
                    to have been lost from the side of Real Madrid fans, a corner was taken and <span>Sergio Ramos</span>
                    scored the equaliser. Real Madrid went on to win the Final with the score of 4-1. As a Real madrid fan, this game and many 
                    other like it will always remind me that as long as the final whistle is not blown yet, the game is still not over and 
                    there is always hope.
