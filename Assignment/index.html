    <section class="Biography">
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Faisal Muhammad Zaid, and indigene of Nasarawa State, Nigeria but currently stays in FCT Abuja.
            I am a student at Altschoolafrica with student ID- <b>ALT/SOE/024/0108</b>, studying software engineering, 
            enrolled in the Frontend track.
            I am also a graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria where i obtained my Bachelor's degree in 
            Metallurgical and Materials Enginnering back in 2021. Since then, i have done my mandatory 
            NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) from 2022 to 2023. After my one year service i got a job at
            the same company i served in, a real estate and construction company called Modern Shelter System
            and Services in Abuja, working as the EA (Executive Assistant) to the CTO till date. Outside the work life,
            I enjoy doing extra curricular activities such as and especially playing football, playing video games,
            watching movies, playing chess, just to mention a few. Additionally, I have always had a bit of passion for tech. 
            The complexities of the web, computers, phones and how the internet works is something that have always 
            fascinated me. I have friends that are software engineers and ui/ux designers and i get amazed anytime 
            i see them write codes and create new projects or develop applications. This, coupled with the passion for tech, 
            the need for a bigger and better source of income, a job where i love what i am doing and getting paid well
            as well as having fun while doing it, peaked my insterest and pushed me to finally go into the tech world.

    <section class="Reason">
    <h2>Reason(s) why i joined Altschoolafrica</h2>
    <p> Last year, when i finally made the decison to learn Software Engineering, a friend of mine introduced me to
        Altschoolafrica. So i looked them up and learnt about their system of learning, and i was immediately drawn
        to it because it aligns with my objectives. Primarily, i joined Altschoolafrica beacause i wanted to join 
        a school and not just any bootcamp or learning on my own, because that way i know i will be more dedicated
        to ensure i finish what i started. Also, i will be prone to less distraction compared to when i chose to learn
        on my own. Again, apart from gaining the valuable knowledge and new tech skills, i get to be a part of a large tech
        community in Altschoolafrica. Additionally, the curriculum and system of education of Altschoolafrica, also 
        being it a virtual school makes it easier and more compatible for me that does a 9 - 5 job beacuse that way,
        i can balance the work and learning together.
